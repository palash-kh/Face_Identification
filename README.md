# Face Identification from the LFW Dataset  (PRML Project Group-14)
## Overview
The Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset challenges automated facial recognition with its real-world, uncontrolled conditions. Our project aims to accurately identify individuals by matching and ranking facial features against a comprehensive database.

## Proposed Approach

### Feature Extraction Methods
To interpret the complex facial data, we implemented three feature extraction strategies:

1. **Pre-trained ResNet Features**:
   Utilizing ResNet's deep learning capabilities, we extract a 2048-dimensional feature vector that encapsulates high-level facial attributes.

2. **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)**:
   HOG descriptors provide a detailed 70,308-dimensional vector, emphasizing edge and gradient structures crucial for object detection.

3. **Local Binary Patterns (LBP)**:
   We used LBP to produce a 256-dimensional vector, effectively capturing the essential textural nuances of facial features.

### Dimensionality Reduction with PCA
To manage the computational load and harmonize feature dimensions, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) streamlined the feature vectors, preserving the most significant data variances.

### Classification Models
Our analytical arsenal included diverse models to ensure robust identification:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Classifies images by analyzing feature vector proximity.
- **Logistic Regression**: Estimates probabilities for binary classifications.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Distinguishes classes with an optimal feature space hyperplane.
- **Random Forest**: Enhances accuracy with a collective of decision trees.
- **XGBoost**: A speed-optimized gradient boosting framework, celebrated for its competitive performance.
